<h1>Arrow Functions</h1>
<p>
    Arrowed Functions are a simple way of building and using functions.
</p>
<p>
    JavaScript is a function heavy language and this can be time consuming and annoying. 
    This is even more so of you are doing chaining function, for example promised and callbacks. 
    This is where Arrow Functions come to the rescue and release a few extra characters of typing.

<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>
    Functions are the core to JavaScript. They are so powerful and used for so many reasons it can be a really challenging to get started.
    There is also some confusing aspects as to how to create a function. This only becomes apparent once you understand how to perform
    Object Orientated Programming within javaScript. For now, review the different ways a function/code-block can be re-used.

    Here we are looking at using a function to repeat a block of code. We could copy and paste the code multiple times
    however if we need to update/maintain this code it can become impossible.
    I have also shown how functions can be created using different techniques.

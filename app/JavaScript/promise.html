<h1>Promise</h1>
<p>
    There is a big problem when developing JavaScript code within the browser.. two lines of code can not run at the same time as
    it's a single thread language and if a single block of code takes too long to execute it can freeze the browser from user input.
</p>
<p>
    A Promise allows you as a developer to give the allusion of asynchronously code, also you are able to place conditional logic
    based on the status of the asynchronously code block.

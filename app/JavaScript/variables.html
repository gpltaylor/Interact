<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>
    You may of heard the saying "There are an unknown number of variables"? This basically means there are too many 
    things to keep track of in order to determine an event or action. A variable is basically a single value or a thing.
    An example of a variable is something you want to monitor that has some meaning to you.

    The weather may be a variable so to how early you leave home to get too work. You know if it's raining it may take some longer.
    Time is also a variables here. This means that if it's raining you need to leave home 10 minutes early.

    The power of a variable is that it can change and therefore allow us to make a "Leave Early" program that works for everyone 
    irregardless of the time you need to leave and how many minutes early they need to set off.

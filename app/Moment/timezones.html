    <h1>Time Zones</h1>

        A very common mistake made by developers is saving dates without the time zone or not converting the date to UTC before saving.
        The issues are compounded in countries like the UK where they have GMT+1 for daily light saving time (BST). This is where the time moves
        back and forwards by an hour to maximise the available sun light, also places where the time is shifted by 30 minutes...

        In New York John submits an application for a loan. He asks to be called at 9am tomorrow. he is called at 10:30pm by a call centre
        in India. Did they get the time wrong? No, they simply called him at 9am IST (time in India).
    </p>
    <p>
        We need to make sure that we translated the date but how? If we have call centres all over the world we would have to save the
        time in multiple columns for each location?
    </p>
    <p>
        We can choose to save the date in a single time zone. For example if we save the date in UTC then we can translate this to the
        correct time. Our example above would select the New York time 9am and therefore save 2pm in the database. We would need to add
        5 hours 30 minutes to convert this to the time in india.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's therefore the job for the application in question to convert the UTC to the local time. If this happens John would get a
        call at 9am irregardless of the call centres location in the world and has it happens your browser support local time out of
        the box!

<h1>When</h1>
<p>
    A common problem within JavaScript is pulling multiple calls from an AJAX/Web-Service at the same time.
    This is especially true when a calculation can only be achieved once all the data is returned.

    Think about linking to multiple shops that sell ice cream. You might call each API at the same time to return
    a list of prices. Once you have all the prices you can then order from the cheapest.
</p>
<p>
    In this case it makes sense to connection to all the shops at the same time, then filter the results for the cheapest, then
    order. This is a complex issues as each API will take a different amount of time to return.
</p>
<p>
    Using 'When' we are able to perform multiple calls, then when we are happy with the data, use min to get the lowest price.
    Note that that call will take four seconds to complete.
    That's because we have to wait for Bills Ice Creams to finish before we sum the details.
    An interesting point is that this code only takes 5 seconds to complete,
    however usable data is return almost instantly. This keeps visitors/users engaged.

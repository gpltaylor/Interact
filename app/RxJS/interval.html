<h1>Interval</h1>
<p>
    Interval allows you to implement conditional loops. Based on other factors where you can chain other RxJS methods together.
    For example, Interval will loop forever, however because we have chained the "take" method we are forcing this to stop once it
    have taken (take) 5 attempts.
</p>
<p>
    Note that we also chain the method "timeInterval" that allows us to record the amount of time between intervals.
    The example below show the number of times the event was called and also the time taken in between calls. Due to the way that
    JavaScript works this won't always be 500 ms.<br/>
    You should note that the results from the map is whats returned to the forEach method but only because that's the last step
    in the chaining of RxJS methods. This hopefully shows the power of this amazing library.

    The goal of this site is to allows other developers to contribute to this project making it better!

    The easiest way to get started is to clone our Git Repos and add a new Pod. Once you have done the work request a Pull.
I will review the work and merge into the site! It's really that easy.

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
    To make a new Pod you need to add two new files and update the list of Pods within the Services Pod Factory.
</p>
<div class="howtosteps">
<p>
    If you wish to make a Pod about the use of Filter. This would sit in the JavaScript Category.
</p>
<p>
    Add a new file in the /app/javaScript/ folder called filter.html and place the content tutorial.
</p>
<p>
    Add a new file in the /app/JavaScript/ folder called filter.js and place the JavaScript code demonstrating the use of the filter function.
    Make note to use the "console.log" method to show the output of the function to the user.
</p>
<p>
    Next updpate the Pod Factory to include the new Pod. This means updating the array of items within podDataFactory.js.<br/>
    This can be obvious but it's vital to make sure you have selected the correct Category ID and Type Id. You should also make the status
    live so this will display within the Menu on the home page
    <pre>
{
    catId: 3, // The Category the Pod will sit under in the main menu
    typeId: 1, // The Type Id of the Pod
    name: 'Promise', // A name for the Pod
    description: 'Changing the order...', // A good description of the Pod to show within the main menu
    location: '/JavaScript/promise', // The location to the Pod
    customHelp: true, // If the Pod has a custom HTML page with the full tutorial (it's advice to do this)
    status: statusType.live // If the Pod should be visible on the Menu
}
</pre>
</p>

<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
    My name is Garry Taylor and I'm the founder of this project. I'm a Technical Developer and agile project manager during the day
    and an avid learner of any technology at night.

<p>
    I find the easiest way to learn is by doing so this site is dedicated to the many JavaScript libraries out there and my effort to learn
    how they function.
</p>

<h2>Why</h2>
<p>
    I learn by doing! However the Internet is full of sample documents, articles and tutorials that are static! This site
    is different in that it lets you run every example (Pod) right on the page. It allows you to edit the sample, play with it
    and try different ideas. Therefore making it easier to learn by doing.
</p>

<h2>Where to Next?</h2>
<p>
    I plan to build on this model including videos and online interactive tutorials. There are other site that do the same thing for
    example www.javascript.com and www.codeschool.com but I want to make a community of learning for free! I personally feel that people
    should not have to pay for knowledge however I acknowledge that resources take time to make and servers cost money. This is why
    I feel an Open Source Community driven site will hold a better chance of success.
